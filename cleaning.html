    <h3>Club Cleaning Procedures</h3>
    <h4>Cleaning</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintenance Officer: (630) 688-2095</li>
      <li>DuPage Flight Center: (630) 208-5600</li>
      <li>DuPage Tower: (630) 587-7823</li>
      <li>NTSB Duty Officer: (844) 373-9922</li>
    </ul>
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <h4>Cleaning</h4>
    When arriving at the end of your flight, always leave enough time before the next pilot’s schedule to complete all required post flight items.
    <ul>
      <li>Club aircraft should be cleaned and secured appropriately. Remove all personal items and trash from the aircraft at the completion of each flight.</li>
      <li>When removing bugs, use the rags at the rear of the hangar with the spray bottles of water. Remove bugs from all leading edge surfaces, not just the wings.</li>
      <li>Clean the windscreen only with Klear-to-Land spray and microfiber cloths. Do not wipe in a circular motion. Wipe the windscreen front to back to minimize scratching.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h4>Fuel and Oil</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Always leave at least two quarts of oil in the cargo compartment for the next pilot.</li>
      <li>Use W100 in the summer and W80 in the winter in the Piper and Cessna aircraft. The Cirrus uses 20W50 all year. The Maintenance officer will notify club members when to switch oil weights. Do not mix oil weights when adding oil. Be sure to know what weight to use before adding oil. Do not over-tighten the oil cap.</li>
      <li><b>Do not add partial quarts and do not add oil when over amounts specified</b></li>
    </ul>

    Preheating prior to engine start is required of club aircraft below freezing temperatures. The maintenance officer will inform the club when post flight procedures require preheaters to be attached. Normally this is from November through March. It is the responsibility of the terminating pilot to attach the pre-heater, blankets and cowl plug (as applicable) to club aircraft not stored in the heated hangar. It is the responsibility of the departing pilot to ensure that the aircraft has been preheated before departure.
    <br /><br/><br/>
    <h4>Securing the Aircraft</h4>
    When leaving, ensure the aircraft cabin is clean, seatbelts are secured, doors and windows are closed and wheels are chocked. Turn off the hangar lights, secure the hangar doors and lock the door and padlocks behind you when leaving.
    <br /><br/><br/>
    <h4>Miscellaneous Operational Items</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>When entering or exiting the aircraft, do not rest any items on any painted surfaces of the aircraft. Even soft items like duffel bags can cause light scratches in the paint.</li>
      <li>Do not place items like headsets on the dashboards of aircraft. There is a risk of scratching the windscreens.</li>
      <li>The Aspen in the Archer has experienced numerous mechanical failures attributed to yoke mount tools. Because of this, the Board of Directors no longer allows personal yoke mounts to be used in club aircraft. Suction cup, window mount units are available for pilots who wish EFB’s to be in full view during flight.</li>
      <li>When departing on a cross country flight out of the local area, be sure to take enough oil for your trip. The club only reimburses for fuel. All other fees are the pilot’s responsibility.</li>
      <li>Leave the aircraft in the same or better condition than when you arrived. Please let the Board know if the planes are not left in “club-ready” condition.</li>
